## Lok Sabha Election Results Dashboard

👋 **Hello!**

I'm Gaurang Ashava, a final-year student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I've applied for the Data Analyst Intern role at Kalvium, and I'd like to share a project I've been working on!

### 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The <a href="Dashboard.pbit">Dashboard</a> showcases the total seats won by all parties in the Lok Sabha Elections. It provides a clear view of how many seats each party has secured.

### 📋 Detailed Report

In addition to the dashboard, there's a <a href="2024 Lok Sabha Election Results Report.pdf">Report</a> offering deep insights into the election results. This report helps to understand the data better and draw meaningful conclusions.

### 🛠️ Data Scraping with Selenium

I used Selenium and Chrome Driver for data scraping from the official Election Commission of India results portal [Election Results 2024](https://results.eci.gov.in/PcResultGenJune2024/index.htm).

- The code for scraping data from the Indore and Mumbai constituencies is included in the respective folders.

### 📁 Dataset

I fixed the basic parameters, including the number of headers and columns. The data is saved in CSV format, which can be easily used to generate visualizations in Power BI.


### 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the CSV files in Power BI to create your own visualizations.

Thankyou for giving me this opportunity! 😊
