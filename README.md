# Task1_Kalvium
Greetings !!

Myself Gaurang Ashava, final year student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I've therefore applied for the role of Data Analyst Intern at Kalvium.

Above is the PowerBI Dashboard with the total seats gained by all the parties and it tells that each party won how many seats in the Lok Sabha Elections.

There is a report which also tells us deep insights of the Results Portal.
